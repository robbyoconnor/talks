# Setting up Spacemacs
## It is super easy.

- Step 1 (if necessary) backup your existing config:
```
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
```

- Step 2: Clone the repository (git clone is abbreviated so it fits as 'gc')

```
gc --recursive https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
```

note:
    Prior to spacemacs, I tried emacs and wasn't successful. Spacemacs is awesome.
