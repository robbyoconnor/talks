### Spacemacs Goals and Philosophy
- Core Pillars (if these are violated, it is not okay)
  - Mnemonic
  - Discoverability
  - Consistency
  - Crowd-Configured


note:
Mnemonic: `SPC b` for buffers; `SPC p` for projects; etc.

Discoveraility: Spacemacs-mode; helm; which-key(formally guide-key)

Consistency: `SPC mgg` (`m` for major-mode), `gg` for "go to think at p"
