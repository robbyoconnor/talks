## Some more useful keybindings to remember
- Zooming text of current buffer `SPC z x`, followed by: "+" to increase, "-" to decrease and "=" to reset.
- Zoom entire frame: `SPC z f`, followed by: "+" to increase, "-" to decrease and "=" to reset.
  - Both of the above will initialize a microstate which is exited by pressing any key other than "+", "-" or "="
