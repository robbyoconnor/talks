## Some more useful keybindings to remember
- Project Management (via Projectile) can is prefixed with `SPC p`
- Zooming text of current buffer `SPC z x`, followed by: "+" to increase, "-" to decrease and "=" to reset.
- Zoom entire frame: `SPC z f`, followed by: "+" to increase, "-" to decrease and "=" to reset.
- Both of the above will initialize a microstate which is exited by pressing any key other than "+", "-" or "="
- `SPC g` is the prefix for magit (It's the git holy land!)
