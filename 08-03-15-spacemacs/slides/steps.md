###Getting started 
- Step 1 (if necessary) backup your existing config:
```
mv ~/.emacs.d ~/.emacs.d.bak
```

- Step 2: Clone the repository (git clone is abbreviated so it fits as 'gc')

```
gc --recursive https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs ~/.emacs.d
```


note:
    `master` is the stable branch and is regularly updated. Switch to the `develop` branch if you want to use the bleeding-edge version.
