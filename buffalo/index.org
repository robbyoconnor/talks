A Go web development eco-system,
designed to make your life easier.

* What is Buffalo???
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 * Inspired by Rails
 * Currently at version 0.12.6
 * Industry standard libraries such as Gorilla Toolkit for routes, sessions, cookies
 * Optional templates, ORM, Tasks/Workers, and Frontend pipeline using Webpack
 * Doesn't tie you down either -- most is optional
* Setting up Buffalo
#+ATTR_REVEAL: :frag (appear)
 * go get -u -v https://github.com/gobuffalo/buffalo/...
 * If you want password auth
 * go get -u -v https://github.com/gobuffalo/buffalo-auth/...
 * We'll use this for our demo app:
 * gR get -u -v https://github.com/gobuffalo/buffalo-goth/...

* Create new buffalo application
For this talk we will make a CFP application which will be donated to the meetup.
